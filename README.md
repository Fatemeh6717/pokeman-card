 For the app that runs in the localhost on port 3000 the routing should work like this: 
 Navigating to http://localhost:3000 the user will see one randomly selected Pokémon card (pokemon id in the range of 1 - 898).
 Navigating to http://localhost:3000/1 the user will see a Pokémon with id 1 (Bulbasaur).
 Navigating to http://localhost:3000/495 the user will see a Pokémon with id 495 (Snivy).
